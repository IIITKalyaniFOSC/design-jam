# My Submission

## Motivation
Since Github's launch in 2007, Github has provided a platform for Open Source and has heavily simplifed its work flow. Github provides, this nice "Histogram of Past Contribution" on the profile of its every user. My logo is essentially a similar histogram with 'FOSC' crafted over it. The idea came into my mind this morning, when I realised that I had just complete my 7 day streak of contributions. :smile:
