# Inspiration
Logos should be unique, visually enticing and deliver its intended message to the target audience. Logos should be simple so that even a lay man can understand it . I spent a lot of time thinking about relevant typography and color combination (though i was limited by my knowledge in Adobe illus) . I also went through numerous websites, magazines etc about logos and all .

# About my Logo
I tried to keep it simple, used a good mix of colors and font styles . The background is textured grid of greenish-bluish cool color (idk the name for that color) and I used warm colors on that for the contrast . To make it look more as a communicating position b/w the viewers and the community I've placed this laptop in the center and a page with lines of code in it . The name is enclosed in angular brackets giving it a look of coding stuff :p  .
