## **Motivation**
Didn't find motivation from anywhere. Just browsing through some images and got slightly **O** shaped share icon, so decided to use it here.

## **What does the logo mean?**
As we know resource and data sharing is one of the key purpose of open source, so I replaced the alphabet **O** in the logo by 4 sharing icon forming an **O**.
