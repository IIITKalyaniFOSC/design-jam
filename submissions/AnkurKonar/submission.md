This is my submission for the Design-jam.

Well, i wanted the logo to resemble what FOSC denotes.

f from facebook, and we all know that facebook is free and connected to over billions of users
o from the github logo that denotes open source.
s from the sublime text editor that allows us to edit code and everything.
c from C# which is an important part of the web development.

p.s. i know its kind of lame but it does resembles a lot. and i assure you there are no copyright issues.
